# EvolvereSuit

I strongly recommend you clone this repository instead of downloading the zip file, as some users reported missing several symlinks(And zip files can not contain symlinks at all). It will also be convenient when you want to download updates, where only the necessary files will be downloaded/updated.

# Cloning the repository:

On terminal type:

`mkdir -p "~/.evolveresuit" && git clone https://github.com/franksouza183/EvolvereSuit ~/.evolveresuit/`

Then to get updates:

`cd "~/.evolveresuit" && git pull origin master && cd`

# Icons moved to [here](https://github.com/franksouza183/Evolvere-Icons)
